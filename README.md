A little embedded system that simplifies the registration of the present students in a lecture.

## About
In a lot of schools nowadays before the start of every lesson the teacher checks which students are present and which aren't. <br>
This operation is usually done through a sheet of paper and by hand. It is very repetitive and time consuming. <br>
Therefore I developed this little device that solves this problem through some simple sensors and a RFID card that every student owns.
